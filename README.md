# Gilded Rose starting position in Python

## Credits

This is heavily inspired from [@emilybache](https://github.com/emilybache)'s kata ([code](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/main/python)) initially created by [Terry Hughes](https://x.com/TerryHughes) in 2011 ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20240525015111/https://iamnotmyself.com/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/)).

The essence of the kata is exactly the same but the surroundings have been adapted to have a setup more easy & intuitive with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/), [Dev containers](https://containers.dev/), [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and more.

## Exercice

For exercise instructions, check out the [docs](./docs/specifications.md) (in french ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·).
