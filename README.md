## Exercice

For exercise instructions, check out the [docs](./docs/specifications.md) (in french 🇫🇷).

- **start the kata**: checkout the tag [`v0.1.0`](https://github.com/fhuitelec/gilded-rose-kata/releases/tag/v0.1.0)
- **see the completed kata**: checkout the tag [`v1.0.0`](https://github.com/fhuitelec/gilded-rose-kata/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
- **get a glance at the process**: though the [`v0.1.0...v1.0.0`](https://github.com/fhuitelec/gilded-rose-kata/compare/v0.1.0...v1.0.0) diff

## Credits

This is heavily inspired from [@emilybache](https://github.com/emilybache)'s kata ([code](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/tree/main/python)) initially created by [Terry Hughes](https://x.com/TerryHughes) in 2011 ([source](https://web.archive.org/web/20240525015111/https://iamnotmyself.com/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/)).

The essence of the kata is exactly the same but the surroundings have been adapted to have a setup more easy & intuitive with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/), [Dev containers](https://containers.dev/), [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and more.

## Setup

You need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed.

```shell
make install
```

## Run the example

```
make run
```

## Run the unit tests

```
make test
```
